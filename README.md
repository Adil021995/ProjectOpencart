About this Project
<h4>
I designed and implemented a Selenium automation project for the "Opencart" website. The project is built using Maven for efficient dependency management and incorporates a design pattern to ensure a structured and maintainable framework. Adil employs an object repository for centralized web element management, enhancing code reusability and simplifying updates to the test scripts.

The automation framework follows a modular approach, with individual classes representing specific pages or modules of the website. These classes include OpenUrl, Create Account, Login, Add Product, My Cart, Billing Details, Delivery Details, Delivery Method, Payment Method, Confirm Order, and Track Order. Each class encapsulates the operations and interactions relevant to its respective page, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

A main class orchestrates the workflow by handling interactions between these modular classes, ensuring seamless integration and execution of test cases. The project effectively validates key functionalities of the Opencart website, such as user registration, product addition to the cart, billing, delivery, payment, and order confirmation.
